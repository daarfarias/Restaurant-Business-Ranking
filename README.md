 THE FUTURE 50

> The Future 50 is a measure of the fastest-growing restaurant concepts with annual sales between 20 million and 50 million. Data is compiled by Technomic. Rankings are based on percent change in systemwide sales from 2018 to 2019; chains must have also opened new units in 2019 to qualify. Unit counts are as of Dec. 31, 2019. When data was not provided, Technomic estimated sales based on public information, comparable concepts, market and other factors.

2. TOP 100 INDEPENDENTS

> RB’s Top 100 Independents ranking is a measure of the highest-grossing independent restaurants. Only restaurant concepts with no more than five locations are considered “independents” for the purpose of this list (although it’s possible a restaurant that shares a name with a chain but is owned and operated separately would qualify, such as Smith & Wollensky in New York City). Rankings are based on gross 2019 food and beverage sales. Information was gathered through surveys. When data wasn’t provided, sales were estimated based on public information, similar concepts and other factors.

3. TOP 250

> The Top 500 Chain Restaurant Report is a measure of the largest restaurant concepts by U.S. systemwide sales, based on results from the 2019 calendar year. Relevant information is accrued using a combination of public company financial filings, direct operator surveying, franchise disclosure documents and proprietary valuation algorithms. Technomic Inc. believes that its sources of information are reliable but does not assume any liability for the accuracy or comprehensiveness of the information published.
